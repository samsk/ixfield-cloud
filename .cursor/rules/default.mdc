Always use type hints
Do not remove comments, unless explicitly requested
If docker-compose.yml is present, use it to run app or tests via 'docker compose'

IMPORTANT:
 * when moving code do not modify it, copy as is, if something is changed mark the place with short reason comment
 
IMPORTANT FOR INITIAL TESTING:
Apply if you are creating new tests. It is expected that tested module works as expected, and tests are not correct yet.
 * If failing test found do not touch the tested module code (non test_*). If test is correct but the test is failing, propose the fix and ask what for permission to apply it !
 * Do not modify tested module logic
 * Create test module one by one and make them pass perfectly first, only then continue with next test module

IMPORTANT FOR TESTING:
 * Do not add stub and helper functions to tested modules, mock it in the test module
