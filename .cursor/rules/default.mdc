always use type hints
do not remove comments, unless requested
IMPORTANT: when moving code do not modify it, copy as is unless necessary, if something is changed mark the place with short reason comment
IMPORTANT: when fixing tests try with fixing the test itself, if it can not be fixed giveup and request code fix
if docker-compose.yml is present, use it to run app or tests via 'docker compose'
