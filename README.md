- **Dynamic Sensor Discovery**: Automatically discovers and maps available sensors
- **Device Information**: Comprehensive device details including address and contact info
- **Service Sequences**: Start maintenance and calibration sequences
- **Multiple Device Support**: Manage multiple pool/spa controllers

### Entity Types
- **Sensors**: Temperature, pH, ORP, flow rates, and more
- **Numbers**: Settable values with validation
- **Selects**: Enum-based controls (modes, settings)
- **Switches**: Boolean controls (pumps, lights, valves)
- **Climate**: Temperature control with mode management
- **Device Info Sensors**: Address, contact, and company information

### Advanced Features
- **Dynamic Control System**: Configurable sensor mappings with pattern matching
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with background verification
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and recovery
- **Type Safety**: Value validation and type checking

## üìã Requirements

- Home Assistant 2023.8.0 or newer
- IXField Cloud account
- Internet connection for API access

## üöÄ Installation

### Option 1: HACS (Recommended)

1. Install [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) if you haven't already
2. Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS
3. Search for "IXField" in the HACS store
4. Click "Download" and restart Home Assistant

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Download the `custom_components/ixfield` folder
2. Copy it to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Initial Setup

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for **IXField**
4. Enter your IXField Cloud credentials:
   - **Email**: Your IXField account email
   - **Password**: Your IXField account password
5. Select the devices you want to integrate
6. Configure device names (optional)
7. Choose whether to extract device info sensors
8. Click **Submit**

### Configuration Options

#### Device Names
You can assign custom names to your devices for easier identification:
```yaml
device_names:
  "device_id_1": "Backyard Pool"
  "device_id_2": "Spa Controller"
```

#### Extract Device Info Sensors
When enabled, creates additional sensors for:
- Device address and location
- Contact information
- Company details
- Controller information
- Connection status

## üîß Dynamic Control System

The integration uses a sophisticated dynamic control system that automatically discovers available sensors and maps them to user-friendly control names.

### Default Controls

| Control | Type | Description | Sensor Patterns |
|---------|------|-------------|-----------------|
| `circulation_pump` | boolean | Circulation pump | `filtrationState`, `pumpState` |
| `lighting` | boolean | Lighting control | `lightsState`, `lightingState` |
| `counterflow` | boolean | Counterflow/jets | `jetstreamState`, `counterflowState` |
| `target_temperature` | temperature | Temperature setting | `*WithSettings`, `targetTemp` |
| `target_ph` | number | pH setting | `targetpH`, `setpointpH` |
| `target_orp` | number | ORP setting | `targetORP`, `setpointORP` |
| `agent_volume` | number | Agent level | `remainingAgentA`, `agentVolume` |
| `heater_mode` | enum | Heater mode | `targetHeaterMode`, `heaterMode` |

### Custom Mappings

You can define custom control mappings for your specific devices:

```yaml
service: ixfield.ixfield_configure_control_mappings
data:
  mappings:
    ozone_generator:
      sensor_patterns: ["ozoneState", "ozoneGenerator"]
      description: "Ozone generator control"
      type: "boolean"
    custom_temp:
      sensor_patterns: ["customTempSensor", "*Temp*"]
      description: "Custom temperature control"
      type: "temperature"
      unit: "¬∞C"
```

## üìä Entity Naming

The integration follows Home Assistant's latest entity naming conventions:

- **Entity Names**: Only identify the data point (e.g., "Temperature", "pH")
- **Friendly Names**: Automatically generated as "Device Name + Entity Name"
- **Entity IDs**: Follow the pattern `entity_type.device_name_entity_name`

### Examples
- Device: "Backyard Pool", Entity: "Temperature" ‚Üí Friendly Name: "Backyard Pool Temperature"
- Device: "Spa Controller", Entity: "pH" ‚Üí Friendly Name: "Spa Controller pH"

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Errors
- Verify your IXField Cloud credentials
- Check that your account has access to the devices
- Ensure your internet connection is stable

#### Missing Sensors
- Use the `ixfield_get_available_controls` service to see available sensors
- Check device connection status
- Try reloading the integration

#### Control Not Working
- Verify the sensor is settable using `ixfield_get_available_controls`
- Check device connection status
- Review the logs for specific error messages

### Logging

Enable debug logging for detailed information:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.ixfield: debug
```

### Useful Services for Troubleshooting

```yaml
# Get device status
service: ixfield.ixfield_device_status
data:
  device_id: "your_device_id"

# Refresh device data
service: ixfield.ixfield_device_refresh
data:
  device_id: "your_device_id"

# Reload all sensors
service: ixfield.ixfield_reload_sensors

# Re-enumerate all sensors
service: ixfield.ixfield_reenumerate_sensors
```

## üìù Configuration Files

### Full Configuration Example

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
ixfield:
  email: "your-email@example.com"
  password: "your-password"
  devices: "device1,device2"
  device_names:
    device1: "Backyard Pool"
    device2: "Spa Controller"
  extract_device_info_sensors: true
```

### Device Configuration

```yaml
# Example device configuration
device_dict:
  "device_id_1":
    name: "Backyard Pool"
    type: "POOL"
  "device_id_2":
    name: "Spa Controller"
    type: "SPA"
```
