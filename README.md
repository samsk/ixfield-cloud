| `circulation_pump` | boolean | Circulation pump | `filtrationState`, `pumpState` |
| `lighting` | boolean | Lighting control | `lightsState`, `lightingState` |
| `counterflow` | boolean | Counterflow/jets | `jetstreamState`, `counterflowState` |
| `target_temperature` | temperature | Temperature setting | `*WithSettings`, `targetTemp` |
| `target_ph` | number | pH setting | `targetpH`, `setpointpH` |
| `target_orp` | number | ORP setting | `targetORP`, `setpointORP` |
| `agent_volume` | number | Agent level | `remainingAgentA`, `agentVolume` |
| `heater_mode` | enum | Heater mode | `targetHeaterMode`, `heaterMode` |

### Custom Mappings

You can define custom control mappings for your specific devices:

```yaml
service: ixfield.configure_control_mappings
data:
  mappings:
    ozone_generator:
      sensor_patterns: ["ozoneState", "ozoneGenerator"]
      description: "Ozone generator control"
      type: "boolean"
    custom_temp:
      sensor_patterns: ["customTempSensor", "*Temp*"]
      description: "Custom temperature control"
      type: "temperature"
      unit: "¬∞C"
```

## üìä Entity Naming

The integration follows Home Assistant's latest entity naming conventions:

- **Entity Names**: Only identify the data point (e.g., "Temperature", "pH")
- **Friendly Names**: Automatically generated as "Device Name + Entity Name"
- **Entity IDs**: Follow the pattern `entity_type.device_name_entity_name`

### Examples
- Device: "Backyard Pool", Entity: "Temperature" ‚Üí Friendly Name: "Backyard Pool Temperature"
- Device: "Spa Controller", Entity: "pH" ‚Üí Friendly Name: "Spa Controller pH"

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Errors
- Verify your IXField Cloud credentials
- Check that your account has access to the devices
- Ensure your internet connection is stable

#### Missing Sensors
- Use the `ixfield.get_available_controls` service to see available sensors
- Check device connection status
- Try reloading the integration

#### Control Not Working
- Verify the sensor is settable using `ixfield.get_available_controls`
- Check device connection status
- Review the logs for specific error messages

### Logging

Enable debug logging for detailed information:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.ixfield: debug
```
